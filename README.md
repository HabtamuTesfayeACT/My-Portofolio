# My-Portofolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my web! I am excited to have you here and hope you enjoy your browsing experience. In this README blog, we will provide you with information on what you can expect to find on our web, how to navigate it, and some of the key features that we offer.

## **Getting Started:**

To start browsing our web, simply type[https://habtamutesfayeact.github.io/Fifia-Random-coutries/](https://habtamutesfayeact.github.io/Hotel-Ekub-paring/) or click on the link above. Once you arrive on our homepage, you will be greeted with a clean, simple design that is easy to navigate. 

## Navigation

To navigate simply scroll down since it's a one page and you can find the functionality and dynamic features and you can simply use the navigation bar it has a four links which are About me ,My Skills, My goals and contacts me section link

## How does it work

The HTML of this website has a navigation bar that is fixed on the top of the page, and it contains links to different sections of the website, such as "About Me", "My Skills", "My Goals", and "Contact".

The header section includes a background image, a heading, and a subheading. The subheading has a typed.js script that makes the text appear as if it's being typed out.

The "About Me" section contains a brief description of the website owner and his interests.

The "My Skills" section includes progress bars that show the website owner's proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and NodeJS.

The "My Goals" section includes four images with captions that represent the website owner's goals, such as web design, app development, hardware maintenance, and graphic design.

The "Contact" section includes a form that visitors can fill out to send a message to the website owner.

The footer section includes the copyright information.

**The javscript part**

This is a JavaScript code that contains several functions and event listeners for a website. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. Navbar shrink function:
This function shrinks the website navbar when the page is scrolled down. It checks if there is a navbar element on the page and adds or removes a 'navbar-shrink' class based on whether the page is scrolled down or not.
2. Activate Bootstrap scrollspy:
This function activates Bootstrap scrollspy on the main nav element. It targets the main navigation element and initializes the ScrollSpy plugin, which highlights the current section of the page in the navigation menu.
3. Collapse responsive navbar:
This function collapses the responsive navbar when the toggler is visible. It targets the toggler button and all navigation items within the responsive navbar. When a navigation item is clicked, it checks if the toggler is visible and simulates a click on the toggler to collapse the navbar.
4. Signature progress:
This function animates the signature progress bar on the page. It calculates the progress percentage based on the data attribute of the progress bar element and animates the bar's width using jQuery's animate() method.
5. Easy selector and event listener functions:
These are helper functions that simplify selecting and adding event listeners to DOM elements. The select() function accepts a string selector and an optional boolean argument to select all matching elements. The on() function accepts an event type, a selector, a listener function, and an optional boolean argument to add the listener to all matching elements.
6. Hero type effect:
This function initializes the Typed.js plugin to create a typing animation effect for a text element on the page. It targets the element with a 'typed' class and retrieves the strings to type from its data attribute.
7. Skills animation:
This function uses the Waypoint.js plugin to animate the progress bars of skills sections when they come into view. It targets the skills content element and loops through each progress bar element, setting its width to the value of its 'aria-valuenow' attribute.
8. Portfolio image swapping:
This function initializes the Isotope.js plugin to create a filterable portfolio section on the page. It targets the portfolio container element and initializes the Isotope plugin with the portfolio items as its child elements. It also targets the portfolio filter elements and adds event listeners to them to filter the portfolio items based on their data attributes.
9. Initiate Pure Counter:
This function initializes the PureCounter.js plugin to create a counter effect for numbers on the page. It targets elements with a 'purecounter' class and initializes the plugin with their values.
